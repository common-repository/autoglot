### Autoglot principles

Autoglot is based on 2 principles: "auto" - automatic and "polyglot" - multilingual. It's created to automatically translate your WordPress blog or website into numerous languages of your choice. Autoglot is fully automatic, **SEO compatible**, and very simple to integrate.

### No subscription required!

Unlike many other translation plugins, **Autoglot does not require any subscription and monthly fees** just to access and display your translation. We use **pay-as-you-go model** where users pay based on how much they need to translate. For more information about our pricing, please refer to the FAQ section.

Once your content is translated, it will be stored in your WordPress database and served to your site visitors **for free**. Even if you stop using Autoglot to translate new content, all pages that have been translated will stay with you.

### Additional notes

Autoglot does not modify your original content and does not change your website structure. **Your blog always stays safe!**

Autoglot currently does not support WooCommerce and other e-commerce and content generation plugins. We can translate only native WordPress posts, pages and other similar content sections. If pieces of content on your website are hard-coded in themes, plugins, or generated dynamically, Autoglot may fail to translate them. However, you can use a separate box in Autoglot dashboard for this kind of strings. They will be translated and used on your pages, where possible.

Autoglot currently supports **49 languages** including English, Spanish, Chinese, French, German, Portuguese, and many more. For the full list of currently supported languages, please check the FAQ section.

### Benefits of Autoglot for Automatic Wordpress Translation

**Autoglot Attracts New Audience.** Did you know that more than 80% of the world Internet audience does not speak or understand English? But the problem is that half of all websites are in English. With Autoglot WordPress Translation plugin, you can translate your website into different languages in a few clicks without paying a fortune!

**Autoglot Increases Traffic.** Up to 3 out of 4 of all queries to search engines are sent in languages other than English. And for these non-English queries search engines show websites in their native languages. Autoglot is fully SEO compatible, it translates titles and metadata, content and taxonomies. Autoglot will add hreflang tags to your blog; it will also add translated pages to XML sitemaps so search engines can find new pages easily!

**Autoglot Means Translation on Autopilot!** Of course, you can hire an independent translator, check the quality of their work, create and manage multilingual versions of your website and lose your time and money. Moreover, keeping your translated content up-to-date can be time-consuming and sometimes impossible. The solution is Autoglot: it will translate and update your content on-the-fly, using the best AI neural machine translation solutions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this free? =

- We do not require any subscription and monthly fees; you don't need to pay for storage or bandwidth. But you will have to pay for translation – and this is where we cannot offer our service for free because we also have to pay fees to NMT services (neural machine translation providers).
- Moreover, when you register, you will have an **initial translation balance** that can be used to check the functionality of our plugin.

= How much do I need to pay for translation? =

- Our pricing depends only on your words count.
- We can offer options where you can pay less than $0.001 per word! This is **100 times cheaper** than working with freelance translators.
- For more information, please check our [pricing page](https://autoglot.com/pricing/).

= What is a "Translation Balance"? =

- This is number of words you can translate. You can check and replenish your translation balance via your [control panel](https://cp.autoglot.com/) using a credit card. For pricing information, please check our [pricing page](https://autoglot.com/pricing/).
- When your blog posts and pages are automatically translated to another language, we will subtract number of words in your content from your translation balance. For example, if your blog post contains 100 words, we will subtract 100 from your translation balance. If you translate your blog post to 2 languages, we will subtract 200 from your translation balance, etc.
- If your translation balance reaches 0, we will not be able to provide new translation for you until you replenish your balance. However, unlike many other plugins, your previous translations will still be available on your website and **will never be disabled** until you decide to do so.

= Is the plugin SEO compatible? =

- Yes, Autoglot follows all the **best search engine optimization practices** and creates fully SEO compatible language versions.
- Autoglot will translate all HTML titles, META tags, schema.org markup, take care of all language settings, hreflang tags, etc.
- Autoglot will also update most SEO plugins' sitemap XML files and add new language URLs there. You will not have to modify them manually!

= Can I translate URLs? =

- Autoglot can translate URLs (inner links to posts and pages). When enabled in Advanced section, Autoglot will translate all WordPress permalinks, e.g. http://site.com/page/ to http://site.com/fr/página/.
- It can also transliterate URLs to url-friendly format, e.g. http://site.com/page/ to http://site.com/ko/peiji/
- This also includes links in "alternate hreflang" and "canonical" tags, links in language switcher, forms, and sitemaps
- All translated URLs can be modified in Translation Editor
- This can be useful for better SEO, improved conversions, and overall user experience
- Please note, enabling or changing settings of Translation and Transliteration of URLs will affect only URLs that have not been translated yet. If you need to update already translated URLs, you need to modify or delete them in Translation Editor.

= Will Autoglot slow down my website? =

- According to numerous tests provided by independent tools, Autoglot does not significantly influence the speed of your sites.
- Moreover, these minor changes may only be noticeable on translated pages. Your original, non-translated pages will not be affected at all.
- The process of automatic translation takes some time. That is why when you first open new pages that have not been translated yet, they might be slow - or even fail to load! Don't worry, no translation will be lost. Once Autoglot completes the automatic translation process, all translated pages will be served from your local DB without delays.
- Finally, Autoglot supports most of caching plugins like LiteSpeed Cache, SpeedyCache, W3 Total Cache, WP Fastest Cache, WP Super Cache, WP-Optimize, etc.
- Translated pages are cached by these plugins and delivered to site visitors with increased speed and performance.

= I activated language switcher but cannot see it on my site. What to do? =

If you're using a caching plugin or server-side caching in your hosting provider, please start with clearing/purging it. Try refreshing your website page or access it in incognito mode.

= I enabled translation but it is very slow or the pages are not loading at all. What to do? =

When you first open an untranslated page, it might take a bit longer to load. This is normal - it just takes some time to extract the content, send it to our API for translation, and get it back. Once it's translated, it's stored in your local database and will load quickly for future visitors, just like any other WordPress page.

= I noticed a bad translation string. Can I change it? =

Yes, you can! Starting from version 2.3.0, Autoglot provides flexible Translation Editor that lets you manually modify translations. This tool displays all records from translation DB with convenient "search" and "filter by language" functions. There is an option to delete translation records so they will be re-generated. The most important, translation editor comes with "Quick Edit" button to let site administrator, translator or proofreader manually adjust and modify translation.

= Can I link to different URLs in different languages? =

Yes, this can be done using our "Links Modifier" tool. This will replace links depending on current language, so you can have a link to site.de on your German pages, site.es on your Spanish pages and so on.

= Can I embed different images and videos in different languages? =

Yes, this can be done using our "Text Replacement" tool. This feature of Autoglot plugin lets you easily change pieces of content on your translated pages. For example, you can change video URLs depending on current language, so you will show different videos in different languages. Additionally, you can localize external links, images, and even your site appearance!

= How to use Autoglot shortcode to insert language switcher? =

You can use a [ag_switcher] shortcode to add a language switcher to your website posts, pages, popups, etc.

Add a "title" argument if you want to set a custom title of this box: [ag_switcher title = "Website Translation"].

Use a "type" argument in order to select a type of language switcher:

1. [ag_switcher type = "smallflagslist"] – small flags.
1. [ag_switcher type = "flagslist"] – large flags.
1. [ag_switcher type = "languageflagslist"] – list of languages with flags.
1. [ag_switcher type = "languagelist"] – list of languages without flags (default).

Add "hidebox = 1" argument if you don't need a default widget-like box around switcher: [ag_switcher hidebox = 1].

= What is the quality of machine translation in Autoglot? =

The quality of **NMT (neural machine translation)** has increased significantly lately. According to some experts, the leading machine translation providers can show the quality comparable to medium-level professional translators. Moreover, many of these translators also use neural machine translation systems to generate the initial translation and then slightly proofread it. Sounds weird? Add the fact that you will have to pay them 100 times more.

Autoglot provides reasonable quality for the fraction of this cost. And it is fully automated!

= Can I find the list of supported languages? =

We currently support these languages. The more languages are coming soon. If you have special requests, do not hesitate to [contact our support](https://autoglot.com/contact-support/).
